        <h2> Accomplishments </h2>

         <p> Cherilynn is a truly talented and well distignuished individual, with some exceptional accomplishments. She took up leadership positions within her Community Champions Council, and has also attained the master speaker award. She was known as the "Super Intern" of SAC.

        <h2> Traits </h2>
        <hr> 

        <p> Cherilynn has some exceptional and notable traits, which makes her really admirable and amazing. These traits are just some of the reasons as to why she is so amazing</p>

        <ol> 
            <li> Firstly, she is a very empathetic and people oriented individual. Cherilynn is a truly selfless individual, who looks beyond just her own needs and wants, but to those around her, and always putting them first (sometimes too much unfortunately). From her passion towards helping the elderly (as seen during her CCC involvements), or the way she always can make a random baby smile and laugh in public, she is someone who is able to quickly connect with someone, even strangers, and spread joy to those around her. In a world that is becoming seemingly colder and distant, this ability is one thats rare, but highly valuable and something that she should be proud of. She always spreads warmth to those around her, and makes the room feel so much brighter. </li>
            <br>
            <li> Secondly, she displays great perseverance. Life for Cherilynn has not been easy, she has been dealt some difficult cards, yet she always manage to push through and never lets any obstacle get in her way. Many would have given up at the situations that she was placed in, yet she did not. Even in her day to day life, she never cuts corners and always does her best, which shows her dedication and perseverance. During her tenure at SAC, she managed to complete tasks (such as finding people for roles) and was able to meet her KPI, earning praise from her supervisors. During projects, she would always take initiative to research and get work done efficiently, showing that she takes the tasks assigned to her seriously. At Gardens By The Bay, besides perfectly executing her role as the prettiest flower exhibit, she was often stationed at the more crowded or demanding locations, as she was someone that could be relied on and trusted to get things done. </li>
            <br>    
            <li> Thirdly, she always shows courage. As mentioned, Cherilynn has some exceptional achievements. However, these achievements were not given to her freely, instead she had to work for her achievements. Her master speaker award required her to deliver a speech, which is not something that can be done easily, and requires lots of courage. She also took on a panelist role in her award ceremony, speaking in front of a crowd of 600 for the first time, which required her to step out of her comfort zone and show great courage and confidnece to execute. Her willingness to step out of her comfort zone and take on opportunities would undoubtedly bring her lots of success in her life. </li>

        <h2>  Love Life </h2>
        <hr>
        <p> Cherilynn is greatly loved by her boyfriend, Jason. Below is an extract from Jason: </p>
        <p> Hi girlfriend!!! Happy Girlfriend Day! This is my first ever time celebrating, and there is no other person I would want to celebrate it with. Looking back at where we are now, I guess we could say that things were unexpected to say the least, but I am so grateful that things have turned out the way it did, and that I get to call you my girlfriend. Being my first relationship, I didnt know what to expect or how to be a good boyfriend, but you've really held my hand each step of the way, and I'm so glad to have progressed so far with you. We're approaching our 5th month soon, and you have made each moment of the last five months so enjoyable. Every morning, I text you good morning and eagerly look forward to meeting or just talking with you, and every night I text goodbye before peacefully sleeping. Each conversation and each outing make my life so full of colour and joy, and I feel I'm growing so much together with you. I hope I always will continue to improve and become a better boyfriend, because I want to give you nothing but the best. Unfortunately we cant be together today, but regardless, I hope this simple present can convey how much I love and appreciate you, and more importantly how amazing you are as a girlfriend and as a person. Hope this website can serve as a reminder of that! </p>
        <p> Based on the above extract, it can be concluded that Jason really loves Cherilynn, and values her so much. She is truly the best thing that has happened to him, and he hopes the both of them stays together for the long run. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Below are more reasons why Jason loves Cherilynn.
        <ol> 
            <li> Firstly, it is her attention and memory of small details. Cherilynn is someone who is very thoughtful, and always remembers things about her boyfriend. For example, she will remember the time that Jason needs to wakeup, and give him a short greeting and talk before going back to sleep. However, she has been strongly recommended to not compromise her rest. Gifts like Billy (Jason's Dog) and the stitch on bicycle are gifts that Jason truly treasures, and it is due to Cherilynn's attentive nature. </li>
            <br>
            <li> Secondly, it is her patience. Previously, Jason was a NS slave and could only be released on the weekends. Even when he is not a stay-in personnel, he may be busy with NS obligations. However, Cherilynn is extremely patient and accomodating to his schedule, and understands when certain plans may not go forward, or if he is unable to meet her on certain occasions. Furthermore, Jason is known as a "blur sotong", a term used to describe individuals who are occasionally lack awareness of their surroundings or general social awareness. Regardless, Cherilynn always puts up with him during such moments, and will patiently explain or help him out. He knows that this patience isnt something to take for granted, and he is grateful for it. </li>
            <br>
            <li> Lastly, he just makes Jason happy. There are certain things that are intangible and hard to put into works, like the way Cherilynn makes Jason's life filled with so much happiness, joy and colour. There is a saying called "happy wife, happy life". Similarly, "happy Cherilynn, happy Jason". Cherilynn is able to make Jason feel safe and comfortable, making him unafraid of any judgement (even when he may display perculiar behaviour) and allowing him to truly be himself. This really helps him to bring out his inner child, and make him feel so full of warmth. </li>
        </ol>
